machine learning 
Let -1 




need to maths learning


1. vector 
2. example of vector
3. a.b and aXb
4. Real-life example (why maths is important)


how polynomial as  Vector(abstract)


what is vector space
what is linear mapping and what is used of it in computations
what is matrix
        multiplication
        addition
        subtractions
        division possible hai




other operations
what is transposing
inverse




Real-life examples


*how 3d images are projected in 2d screen
* Importance of matrices in Image processing algorithms
* of a group of equations can be represented in matrix form














You made understand code and flow in my work, how notebooks and pythons files work together.
Parallel we have done python basics again.


And now work is also stable, her manager said great progress.
Waiting on the feedback because we have enough work which is already done
